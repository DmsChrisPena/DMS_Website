    <p class="para-content mission-main-para">
        Our industry has always been plagued by a gap between demand for industry experts and the supply of a skilled labor force; we see this gap as increasing in the future. Particularly due to recent developments in fracking and LNG technology, the gas industry is on the course to rapidly grow. The primary problem is that companies still try, buy, and implement solutions like they did in the 80's.
        <br /><br />
        Our mission here at DMS is simple:<br />
        <b>We are here to provide effective and easy-to-implement solutions that close this gap, without costing millions of dollars.</b>
