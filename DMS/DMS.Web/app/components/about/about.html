                Our industry has always been fazed with a gap between industry positions and skilled labor force; we see this gap as increasing in the future. The gas industry is on the course to rapidly grow particularly due to recent developments in fracking and LNG technology. The primary problem is that companies still try, buy and implement solutions like they did in the 80's.
