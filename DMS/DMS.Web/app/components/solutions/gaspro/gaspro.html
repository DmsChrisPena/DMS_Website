                                GasPro provides the most powerful user defined ad hoc query and reporting tools in the industry.  In addition to the ad hoc reports, GasPro also has over 150 pre-defined reports that cover all the standard reporting functions. Many of these pre-defined reports also have multi-select filtering and user-defined sorts and subtotals.
                            </p>
                            <h4>Ad Hoc Reports</h4>
                            <p>
                                In each major section of GasPro, an Ad Hoc style report has been created to allow the user to create very complex and customized queries that they can both run and save (to be run again at a later time). These reports all have multi-select capabilities on numerous filters, plus user-defined sorts and subtotals. The combination of all these filters and sorts provides the user with the capability to create over 5,000 different report configurations (per GasPro section). All of the ad hoc reports also have the capability to extract their results via a standard CSV file format (which can be easily read by Excel, Lotus, Access, etc.)
                            </p>
                            <h4>MDQ Available</h4>

                                GasPro tracks your current MDQ position in real-time and provides a graphical display showing the Total MDQ, the volumes that have been released, the volumes scheduled and the remaining MDQ. Scheduled volumes are also broken down by transaction type (firm, interruptible, pooling, etc.) A simple double-click on any part of the graph will display the detailed report behind the numbers.

Detailed reports with simple double-click drill down capability, make it easy to determine exactly where and why any variances occur. Views are provided at the pipeline and at the point level and both views provide both a daily and a monthly selection.
