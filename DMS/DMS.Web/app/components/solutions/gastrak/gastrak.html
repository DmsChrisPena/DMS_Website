                    <p>
                        GasTrak has the ability to associate wells with a Central Delivery Point (CDP). Scheduled volumes entered at these wellhead locations are automatically transferred to the CDP for pipeline scheduling. Actual volumes at the CDP are then automatically allocated back to the wellhead suppliers based on the percentage of scheduled volumes.
                    </p>
                    <h4>Processing Plants</h4>
                    <p>
                        The ability to schedule volumes through processing plants can be done on a multiple wellhead basis. The system automatically calculates the residue volumes, taking into account: bypass, transport fuel, PTR, and plant fuel volumes. This residue gas can now be scheduled to storage or to its ultimate use.
                    </p>
                    <h4>Plant Actuals</h4>
                    <p>
                        The GasTrak Plant Actuals module facilitates the true-up of the scheduled volumes and PTR estimates to the plant statement information. The plant liquid units and the associated revenues are then accounted for appropriately depending on the recipient of the plant proceeds.

                        GasTrak automatically captures all exposure transactions throughout the system and consolidates them into one powerful risk analysis query / ad hoc that presents real-time exposure and liquidity positions. This very important tool provides the user with the needed information to ensure that the company’s risk tolerance policy is enforced.

                    <p>
                        As utility companies leverage under-utilized assets (transport & storage capacities) through asset optimization efforts, the GasTrak system is equipped to support asset optimization through tracking, accounting, and reporting on all transactions. Once the profits have been automatically calculated they are ready to be distributed to the participating profit centers.
